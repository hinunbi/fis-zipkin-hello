# FIS Spring-Boot Zipkin Hello

This example demonstrates how you can use Apache Camel Zipkin component with Spring Boot.

It uses Spring Boot to send a zipkin event message every 5th second, and routes the message to a log.

### Running the application on local host


The example can be built and run on local host:

The zipkin connection url environment variable, "ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT" or Java system property should be set when running the example.

    mvn -s configuration/settings.xml spring-boot:run -DZIPKIN_ENDPOINT=http://zipkinhost:9411/api/v2/spans


### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/index.html).
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)

The example can be built and run on OpenShift using a single goal:

    mvn -s configuration/settings.xml fabric8:deploy

When the example runs in OpenShift, you can use the OpenShift client tool to inspect the status

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the openshift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/getting_started/developers_console.html#developers-console-video) to manage the
running pods, and view logs and much more.
